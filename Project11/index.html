<h2>Introduction</h2>
<article>
<p>
A programming language is a system of notation for writing computer programs.Programming languages are described in terms of their syntax (form) and semantics (meaning), usually defined by a formal language. 
</p>
<p>
Languages usually provide features such as a type system, variables, and mechanisms for error handling. An implementation of a programming language is required in order to execute programs, namely an interpreter or a compiler. An interpreter directly executes the source code, while a compiler produces an executable program.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Computer architecture has strongly influenced the design of programming languages, with the most common type developed to perform well on the popular von Neumann architecture.
</li>
<li>
 While early programming languages were closely tied to the hardware, over time they have developed more abstraction to hide implementation details for greater simplicity.

<h2>What you should already know</h2>
<article>
<p>This guide assumes you have the following basic background:</p>
<ul>
<li>
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a standard markup language used to create web pages. 
</li>
<li>CSS is used to define styles for your web pages, including the design, layout and variations in display for different devices and screen sizes.</li>
<li>JavaScript is a programming language that makes web pages more interactive.</li>
</ul>

<section id="C_and_Java">
<h2>C and Java</h2>
<article>
<p>
C and Java are both popular programming languages, but the key difference is that C is a procedural language focused on low-level system programming and direct hardware control, while Java is an object-oriented language prioritizing platform independence and ease of use, making it better suited for general application development; essentially, C gives you more control over hardware while Java abstracts away many complexities for easier coding. 
</p>
<p>
C is a compiled language that is it converts the code into machine language so that it could be understood by the machine or system. Java is an Interpreted language that is in Java, the code is first transformed into bytecode and that bytecode is then executed by the JVM (Java Virtual Machine).</p>

<section id="Hello_world">
<h2>Hello World</h2>
<article>
 To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write
          your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:
          <code >function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
            greetMe("World");
          </code>
Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your
          browser!

<section id="Variables">
 <h2>Variables</h2>
  <article>
   <p>
      You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application.The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain
            rules.
  </p>In JavaScript, a variable is a named container that stores values. Variables can store numbers, strings, and objects. You can use variables to store information that you might need to use or modify again. 
</p>
 <p> A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or
            dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9).
            Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters
            "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z"
            (lowercase).
